#What is the difference between a Class I, Class II, and Class III recall?
A Class I recall is a dangerous or defective product that predictably could cause serious health problems or death. Examples include: food found to contain botulinum toxin, food with undeclared allergens, a label mix-up on a lifesaving drug, or a defective artificial heart valve.
A Class II recall is a product that might cause a temporary health problem, or pose only a slight threat of a serious nature. Example: a drug that is under-strength but that is not used to treat life-threatening situations.
A Class III recall is a product that is unlikely to cause any adverse health reaction, but that violate FDA labelling or manufacturing laws. Examples include: a minor container defect and lack of English labelling in a retail food.
