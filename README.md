We developed an interactive web application for the general public to search FDA food recalls and enforcement data nationwide.
This information can be used to determine the name and description of FDA food recalled products that the general public might
have in their home or might have an interest in purchasing for their consumption. It also helps to determine if any
of their recent illness is due to the consumption of the FDA recalled product.

This prototype is designed and developed to be easily accessible and convenient to use on any [mobile device] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Screenshots). 

##### Technical Approach :

Management approved the implementation and allocation of resources for the GSA FDA RFQ (4QTFHS150004) prototype in accordance with the published guidelines. 

This project was successfully implemented using Agile scrum development methodology. 

Minimum Viable Product features were planned,prioritized and executed in the first sprint (5 days). 
Upon extension of the RFQ deadline we planned and implemented the second sprint(5 days) with additional features.

[Product Backlog] (https://github.com/UBTUS/USFoodRecall/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Artifacts/Product%20Backlog).

[Sprint Backlog] (https://github.com/UBTUS/USFoodRecall/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Artifacts/Sprint%20Backlog).

A five member cross-functional agile team was formed,consisting of Product Owner,Scrum Master and three Team members 
(Technical Architect , Front End Web Developer and Dev Ops Engineer). 

The Product Owner acted as the decision maker,accountable for complete prototype backlog definition,prioritization and quality delivery. Product Owner used FDA datasets and API 
calls mentioned in RFQ (4QTFHS150004) as the base for Product Backlog definition.

The Scrum master conducted the [Sprint Planning Meeting] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Meeting%20Notes/1.%20Sprint%20Planning) 
in which the Product Owner explained , prioritized and defined acceptance criteria for the first sprint Product Backlog Items (PBI). Scrum Master was accountable for on 
time delivery of product within allocated budget. The Team members played planning poker for PBI's and provided estimated story points with all team members acceptance. 
Some of the PBI's were pushed back to product backlog with product owners approval as the estimated story points exceeded team velocity.Team velocity was based on 
past projects performance. The Agile team identified required tasks for each PBI in the first sprint and defined [Sprint Backlog] (https://github.com/UBTUS/USFoodRecall/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Artifacts/Sprint%20Backlog).

The Scrum Master facilitated the [Daily Scrum meeting] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Meeting%20Notes/2.%20Daily%20Scrum) in which the team announced their completed, planned tasks and potential road blocks (impediments) to 
fellow team members.Important meeting points were noted by scrum master and followed up with the concerned individuals for a resolution on potential impediments.Agile Team updated Scrum Board while they were making progress. 

The Agile Team worked closely with the Product Owner throughout product development. We recorded and implemented feedback at every stage. This process helped us build
the product in accordance with user preferences and expectations. We automated code integration,test execution and application build with [Continuous integration server] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Build%20Screenshots) (Jenkins).
Feedback on planned features were implemented and new feature requests from users feedback were documented as a wishlist. This human centric process improved usability and value of the application.

Product owner validated each user story with defined acceptance criteria and provided signoff. The Scrum Master facilitated the [Sprint Demo / Sprint Review meeting ] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Meeting%20Notes/3.%20Sprint%20Review) for the Product Owner to officially demonstrate the prototype to end users on last day of sprint.

The Scrum Master also facilitated the [Sprint Retrospective meeting] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Meeting%20Notes/4.%20Sprint%20Retrospective) on the last day.The Team reviewed the implementation procedure, discussed alternative ways to handle sprint tasks for 
optimum team performace and approach to improvements. The Scrum Master logged action items and shared with team.

We followed similar Agile approach for Sprint 2 to implement additional features to submitted prototype.

We followed the [US Digital Services Playbook] (https://github.com/UBTUS/USFoodRecall/tree/master/docs/US%20Digital%20Services%20Playbook) for this implementation. Taken actions were documented and  Playbook questionaire were answered.
