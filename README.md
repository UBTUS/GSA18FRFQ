We developed an interactive web application for the general public to search FDA food recalls and enforcement data.
This application helps the general public to identfy FDA recalled food products in their home state as well as nationwide.This 
information can be used to determine if any of their recent illness is due to the consumption of the FDA recalled product.

This prototype is designed and developed to be easily accessible and convenient to use on any [mobile device] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Screenshots). 

##### Technical Approach :

We successfully implemented this project with Agile Scrum development methodology. All basic features for this prototype(Minimum Viable Product)
is planned and executed in first sprint (5 day). Additional features are added in second sprint(5 day).

Project is initiated with an approval from higher management to implement prototype for public use with fda food data in compliance 
to GSA RFQ guidelines.

We formed 5 member cross-functional agile team with Product Owner , Scrum Master and 3 Team members. Team members are Technical Architect , 
Front End Web Designer and Dev Ops Engineer. Product Manager is made accountable for prototype backlog definition,prioritization and quality delivery.

Scrum master conducted [Sprint planning meeting] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Meeting%20Notes/1.%20Sprint%20Planning) and explained product backlog items (User stories) for prototype to team. Product owner also prioritized
and defined acceptance criteria for user stories then Agile team played planning poker and provided points for each user story selected for first sprint. 
Team throughly discussed and provided estimated story points withh all team members acceptance. Some of user stories are pushed back to product backlog 
with product owners approval as estimated story points exceeds team velocity.
Agile team identified required tasks for each finalized user story for first sprint and prepared sprint backlog.

Team started implementing User Stories and updating progress to each other in daily scrum meeting facilitated by Scrum Master. [Daily scrum standup] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Meeting%20Notes/2.%20Daily%20Scrum) meeting was
conducted everyday morning. Important meeting points are noted by scrum master and followedup with respective parties for resolution.

Team closely worked with product owner and end users during product development. We took their feedback at every step. This process helps us to build
product in accordance to user needs and mindset. We automated code integration , test execution and application 
build with [Continuous integration server] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Build%20Screenshots) (Jenkins).

With this process, we managed to come up with application that can be given to user for beta testing. We took feedback from all selected end users
and implemented them. This human centric design process improves usability of application.

On last day of sprint Scrum master conducted [Sprint review meeting] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Meeting%20Notes/3.%20Sprint%20Review) and demonstarted product to product owner and selected end users. Product owner
validated each user story against acceptance criteria then provided signoff to user stories. 

Team also had [retrospective meeting] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Meeting%20Notes/4.%20Sprint%20Retrospective) on last day and discussed implementation procedure on completed sprint.
Team also noticed alternative ways to handle sprint tasks for better team performace.All discussions are logged and shared with team.


We followed same approach for Sprint 2 to implement additional features to submitted prototype.
