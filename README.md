We developed user friendly , mobile device compatible web application for general public , using FDA food recalls and enforcement data.
This applications helps people to find FDA recalled food products in their state , also nataionwide recalled food products.

This food recall information helps people to clarify whether any of their recent sickenss is due to consumption of recalled product.

##### Technical Approach :

We successfully implemented this project with Agile development methodology. All basic features for this prototype(Minimum Viable Product)
is planned and executed in first sprint (5 day). Additional features are added in second sprint(4 day).

Project is initiated with approval from higher management to implement prototype for public use with fda food data in compliance 
to GSA RFQ guidelines.

Six member cross-functional agile team was formed consists of Product Manager , Technical Architect, 
Content Designer , Front End Web Designer , Dev Ops Engineer and Usability Tester. Product Manager is made 
accountable for prototype backlog definition and quality delivery.

We conducted [Sprint planning meeting] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Meeting%20Notes/1.%20Sprint%20Planning) to understand product owners backlog items (User stories) for prototype. Product owner prioritized
and defined acceptance criteria for user stories then Agile team played planning poker and provided points for each user story selected for first sprint. 
Team throughly discussed and provided estimated story points withh all team members acceptance. Some of user stories are pushed back to product backlog 
with product owners approval as estimated story points exceeds team velocity.
Agile team identified required tasks for each finalized user story for first sprint and prepared sprint backlog.

Team started implementing Sprint backlog items and updating progress to each other in daily scrum meeting. [Daily scrum standup] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Meeting%20Notes/2.%20Daily%20Scrum) meeting was
conducted everyday morning. Important meeting points are noted by scrum master and followedup with respective parties for resolution.

We closely worked with product owner and demonstrated product features as soon as they are ready. This process helps us to build
product in accordance to user needs and mindset. We automated code integration , test execution and application 
build with [Continuous integration server] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Build%20Screenshots) (Jenkins).

With this process, we managed to come up with application that cann be given to user for beta testing. We took feedback from all selected end users
and implemented them. This human centric design process improves usability of application.

On last day of sprint we conducted [Sprint review meeting] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Meeting%20Notes/3.%20Sprint%20Review) and demonstarted product to product owner and selected end users. Product owner
validated each user story against acceptance criteria then provided signoff to user stories. 

We had [retrospective meeting] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Meeting%20Notes/4.%20Sprint%20Retrospective) on same day and discussed pain points on completed sprint.
Team also noticed better ways to handle tasks for better team performace.All discussions are logged and shared with team.


We followed same approach for Sprint 2 to implement additional features to submitted prototype.


RFQ Requirement evidence links:

a. assigned one leader, gave that person authority and responsibility and held that person
accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted

b. assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes at a minimum two of
the labor categories limited to the Development Pool labor categories to develop the
prototype as quoted in Attachment C. The quoter’s proposed mix of labor categories and
level of effort for its working prototype, as reflected in Attachment C, shall be evaluated
to assess the quoter’s understanding and capability to supply agile delivery services

c. used at least five modern and open-source technologies, regardless of architectural layer
(frontend, backend etc)

d. deployed the prototype on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service
(PaaS) provider, and indicated which provider was used

e. wrote unit tests for their code

f. set up or used a continuous integration system to automate the running of tests and
continuously deployed their code to their IaaS or PaaS provider

g. set up or used configuration management

h. set up or used continuous monitoring

i. deploy their software in a container (i.e., utilized operating-system-level virtualization)

j. used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype

k. provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine

l. prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly
licensed and free of charge
