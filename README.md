We developed user friendly , mobile device compatible web application for general public , using FDA food recalls and enforcement data.
This applications helps people to find FDA recalled food products in their state , also nataionwide recalled food products.

This food recall information helps people to clarify whether any of their recent sickenss is due to consumption of recalled product.

##### Technical Approach :

We successfully implemented this project with Agile development methodology. All basic features for this prototype(Minimum Viable Product)
is planned and executed in first sprint (5 day). Additional features are added in second sprint(4 day).

Project is initiated with approval from higher management to implement prototype for public use with fda food data in compliance 
to GSA RFQ guidelines.

Six member cross-functional agile team was formed consists of Product Manager , Technical Architect, 
Content Designer , Front End Web Designer , Dev Ops Engineer and Usability Tester. Product Manager is made 
accountable for prototype backlog definition and quality delivery.

We conducted sprint planning meeting to understand product owners backlog items (User stories) for prototype. Product owner prioritized
and defined acceptance criteria for user stories then Agile team played planning poker and provided points for each user story selected for first sprint. 
Team throughly discussed and provided estimated story points withh all team members acceptance. Some of user stories are pushed back to product backlog 
with product owners approval as estimated story points exceeds team velocity.
Agile team identified required tasks for each finalized user story for first sprint and prepared sprint backlog.

Team started implementing Sprint backlog items and updating progress to each other in daily scrum meeting. Daily scrum standup meeting was
conducted everyday @ 10:00 AM EDT. Important meeting points are noted by scrum master and followedup with respective parties for resolution.

We closely worked with product owner and demonstrated product features as soon as they are ready. This process helps us to build
product in accordance to user needs and mindset. We automated code integration , test execution and application 
build with integration server(Jenkins).

With this process, we managed to come up with application that cann be given to user for beta testing. We took feedback from all selected end users
and implemented them. This human centric design process improves usability of application.

On last day of sprint we conducted Sprint review meeting and demonstarted product to product owner and selected end users. Product owner
validated each user story against acceptance criteria then provided signoff to user stories. 

We had retrospective meeting on same day and discussed pain points on completed sprint.
Team also noticed better ways to handle tasks for better team performace.All discussions are logged and shared with team.


We followed same approach for Sprint 2 to implement additional features to submitted prototype.
