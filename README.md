We developed an interactive web application for the general public to search FDA food recalls and enforcement data.
This application helps the general public to identfy FDA recalled food products in their home state as well as nationwide.This 
information can be used to determine if any of their recent illness is due to the consumption of the FDA recalled product.

This prototype is designed and developed to be easily accessible and convenient to use on any [mobile device] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Screenshots). 

##### Technical Approach :

Management approved the implementation and allocation of resources for the GSA FDA RFQ prototype in accordance with the published guidelines. 

This project was successfully implemented using Agile scrum development methodology. 

Minimum Viable Product features were planned,prioritized and executed in the first sprint (5 days). 
Upon extension of the RFQ deadline we planned and implemented the second sprint(5 days) with additional features.

We assembled a five member cross-functional agile team consisting of Product Owner , Scrum Master and three Team members 
(Technical Architect , Front End Web Designer and Dev Ops Engineer). 

The Product Owner acted as the decision maker , accountable for complete prototype backlog definition,prioritization and ontime quality delivery within budget.

The Scrum master conducted  the first [Sprint planning meeting] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Meeting%20Notes/1.%20Sprint%20Planning) 
in which the product owner explained , prioritized and defined acceptance criteria for the first sprint product backlog items (PBI/User stories).

The Team members played planning poker for PBI's and provided estimated story points with all team members acceptance. 
Some of the PBI's were pushed back to product backlog with product owners approval as the estimated story points exceeded team velocity.

The Agile team identified required tasks for each PBI in the first sprint and defined sprint backlog.

The Scrum Master facilitated the [daily scrum meeting] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Meeting%20Notes/2.%20Daily%20Scrum) in which the team announced their individual progress,tasks on hand and potential road blocks 
to fellow team members. Important meeting points are noted by scrum master and followedup with respective parties for resolution.

Team closely worked with product owner and end users during product development. We took their feedback at every step. This process helps us to build
product in accordance to user needs and mindset. We automated code integration , test execution and application 
build with [Continuous integration server] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Build%20Screenshots) (Jenkins).

With this process, we managed to come up with application that can be given to user for beta testing. We took feedback from all selected end users
and implemented them. This human centric design process improves usability of application.

On last day of sprint Scrum master conducted [Sprint review meeting] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Meeting%20Notes/3.%20Sprint%20Review) and demonstarted product to product owner and selected end users. Product owner
validated each user story against acceptance criteria then provided signoff to user stories. 

Team also had [retrospective meeting] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Meeting%20Notes/4.%20Sprint%20Retrospective) on last day and discussed implementation procedure on completed sprint.
Team also noticed alternative ways to handle sprint tasks for better team performace.All discussions are logged and shared with team.


We followed same approach for Sprint 2 to implement additional features to submitted prototype.
