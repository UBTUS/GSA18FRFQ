#Installing the Application

###Prerequisites

+ Jekyll (And Dependencies) - [All Platforms](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
+ Apache2 Web Server - [Ubuntu 14.04](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/httpd.html)

###Building

The process of building the application, within the context of this prototype, is performed on the same server that hosts it. The following set of command line instructions, assuming the prerequisites are installed correctly, will result in a successful build of the site. This build can be deployed on any standard http container; in our case we use Apache2.

	cd /tmp
	wget https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/archive/master.zip
	unzip master.zip
	cd GSA18FRFQ-master/src
	jekyll build
	cd _site
	
###Deploying

The following instructions assume that you have successfully built the application and are suitably prepared to deploy it. We recommend clearing out the *html* directory or modifying this command depending on your set up.

	mv * /var/www/html #Apache2 web hosting directory
	
#Preparing a Development Environment

###Recommended Applications

This prototype was created using free and open source software. Because of the additional complexity of running Jekyll on windows and the short notice of this project, we deferred all building to the Ubuntu server hosting our continuous integration and web container. The software used by individual developers is listed below.

+ [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - Used for all code editing.
+ [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) - Used for rapid prototyping and testing css styling.
+ [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Used for version control and collaboration.

###Setting up Your Environment

After installing the above windows applications (and properly configuring them according to installation instructions), working with this prototype is very easy. Using the git client, navigate to your desired directory and run the following command...

	git clone https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ.git
	
This should be all that is required to work on the application. Pushing changes is as simple as running the `git commit` and `git push` commands as needed. All testing, building, and deploying is deferred to the Ubuntu continuous integration server for this prototype.

###Adding or Changing Content

To add or change content, you must simply modify the desired content in the src/ folder and push it to the repo.

###Adding or Changing Test Cases

To add or change a selenium test case, you must simply modify the test xml files in the tests/ folder as desired and push it to the repo.

###Setting up the Continuous Integration Environment

Setting up the continuous integration server on Ubuntu from scratch is tedious, but fairly simple. Notes for the set-up process can be found below. Additional set-up may be required within the jenkins control panels, as needed.

Please note that the only significantly abnormal part of this process is the headless selenium environment. Leaving this out omits the post deployment testing, but results in a significantly easier setup.
