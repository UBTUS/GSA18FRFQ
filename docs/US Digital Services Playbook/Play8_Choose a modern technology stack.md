### Choose a modern technology stack



The technology decisions we make need to enable development teams to work efficiently and enable services to scale easily and cost-effectively. Our choices for hosting infrastructure, databases, software frameworks, programming languages and the rest of the technology stack should seek to avoid vendor lock-in and match what successful modern consumer and enterprise software companies would choose today. In particular, digital services teams should consider using open source, cloud-based, and commodity solutions across the technology stack, because of their widespread adoption and support by successful consumer and enterprise technology companies in the private sector.

#### checklist
- [ ] Choose software frameworks that are commonly used by private-sector companies creating similar services

* We built prototype using all open source technologies

- [ ] Whenever possible, ensure that software can be deployed on a variety of commodity hardware types

* No resource contention , prototype is developed to work on any commodity hardware.

- [ ] Ensure that each project has clear, understandable instructions for setting up a local development environment, and that team members can be quickly added or removed from projects

* We have user manual how to setup application. [Installation instructions] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/blob/master/User_Manual.md)

- [ ] [Consider open source software solutions](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/egov_docs/memotociostechnologyneutrality.pdf) at every layer of the stack

* Used all open source technologies.

#### key questions
- What is your development stack and why did you choose it?

*A*. Important technology stack is:

*Ubuntu : Open Source secured Linux Operating System

*Apache : Open Source web server.

*GitHub : Version control system and repository.

*Jenkins: Continouus Integration server.

*HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript/BootStrap : Used for frontend development.

- Which databases are you using and why did you choose them?

*A*.Not used any database. Built around fda datasets using API.

- How long does it take for a new team member to start developing?

*A*. Instant. We documented required steps to setup application. [Setup instructions] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/blob/master/User_Manual.md)
