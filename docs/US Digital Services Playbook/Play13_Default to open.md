### Default to open


When we collaborate in the open and publish our data publicly, we can improve Government together. By building services more openly and publishing open data, we simplify the public’s access to government services and information, allow the public to contribute easily, and enable reuse by entrepreneurs, nonprofits, other agencies, and the public.

#### checklist

* Feedback form is available for reports and also can open issues on github.

- [ ] Provide datasets to the public, in their entirety, through bulk downloads and APIs (application programming interfaces)

* Not applicable for this application.

- [ ] Ensure that data from the service is explicitly in the public domain, and that rights are waived globally via an international public domain dedication, such as the “Creative Commons Zero” waiver
