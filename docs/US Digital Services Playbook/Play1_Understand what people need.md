# USDS Playbook Checklist and Evaluation Form

## Play: 1
### Understand what people need

We must begin digital projects by exploring and pinpointing the needs of the people who will use the service, and the ways the service will fit into their lives. Whether the users are members of the public or government employees, policy makers must include real people in their design process from the beginning. The needs of people — not constraints of government structures or silos — should inform technical and design decisions. We need to continually test the products we build with real people to keep us honest about what is important.

#### checklist
- [ ] Early in the project, spend time with current and prospective users of the service
* Users of this application are members of general public. We discussed FDA food recall and enforcement datasets with different background people
and prepared user needs. Product manager prepared backlog items from users wish list. [Product Backlog] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Artifacts/Product%20Backlog)

- [ ] Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent
* We interviewed different age group people to understand their view and need of FDA food data. Product backlog is defined around needs and thoughts of people.

- [ ] Test prototypes of solutions with real people, in the field if possible
* Prototype is tested with different age group people and incorporated their feedback. Its completely user feedback driven.

- [ ] Document the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences
* Documented end users wish list in product backlog , acceptance criteria is defined based on users preference and expected behaviour of product. 

- [ ] Share findings with the team and agency leadership
* All product development process and communication is open and transperant. We user open source tool named "Phabricator toool" for team collabaration and communication.

- [ ] Create a prioritized list of tasks the user is trying to accomplish, also known as "user stories"
* User stories are developed based on user needs then prioritized and planned for execution. [Product Backlog] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Artifacts/Product%20Backlog)
[Sprint Backlog] (https://github.com/UBTUS/GSA18FRFQ/tree/master/docs/Agile%20Artifacts/Sprint%20Backlog)

- [ ] As the digital service is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it meets people’s needs
* Meeting people needs is our first priority in service development. Involved end users to regulary test product as we evolve with new features.


#### key questions

4. Which people will have the most difficulty with the service?

*A*. General public. Without user friendly online tool its difficult to find specific FDA recalled food information with various search fields.

5. Which research methods were used?

*A*. Interviews with different age group people.

6. What were the key findings?

*A*. FDA food recall information is very critical helps to know recalled products and their side effects.

*A*. Product backlog is first point of reference for findings listed from end users. We also maintain wishlist of users in repository.

8. How often are you testing with real people?

*A*. We are continuously testing product as it evolves. Most of our test cases are automated so anything wrong team knows immediately.
