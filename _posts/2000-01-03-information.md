				<td>There are no plans for the openFDA initiative to change the RES release protocols. At this time it is anticipated that RES downloads will continue to be available from the same site on the same weekly schedule. OpenFDA is a research project to make access to these datasets easier, not replace the current process. The information available through openFDA is not for clinical or production use and is in beta testing. While FDA makes every effort to ensure the data is accurate, it should be assumed that all results are not validated.</td>
